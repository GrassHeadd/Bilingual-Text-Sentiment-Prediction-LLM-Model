    "# 1.2 Synthetic Data Generation\n",
    "Main logic for my generation:\n",
    "1. Have a defined sentiment for all of my prompting as a baseline for generating the input and output\n",
    "    - The generation is a diversed mix of zero shot and few shot prompting on the model to strike a balance between the variety of the prompts\n",
    "    - Prompt is requested to generate of around 5-30 words which covers the 25% to 75% percentile to ensure a diverse but not obsecure range of data is generated\n",
    "    - The direct request to generate inputs of a certain sentiment ensures the initial generation to already have a more or less accurate output\n",
    "    - This is done as I realise that the model is rather weak and requires extensive handhelding in generation\n",
    "2. Have a very small sample(of about 30 samples) of real life data inputs from my peers to make the data more diverse again and also provide a sense of human authenticity to it\n",
    "3. Evaluation is done with a heuristic to make sure the data generated is of certain quality"
